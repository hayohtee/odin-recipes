    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      A hot dog is a food consisting of a grilled or steamed sausage served in
      the slit of a partially sliced bun. The term hot dog can also refer to the
      sausage itself. The sausage used is a wiener or a frankfurter. The names
      of these sausages also commonly refer to their assembled dish.
